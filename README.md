x80sv
=====

Container for x80svn description, simulation and drivers



Notes on install and usage
-----


to use the robot over serial-usb, make sure the usb ports of the pc are configured properly, and the user is added to the __dialout__ group.
It is important that the files from __/x80sv_driver/udev__ are exported to the  __/etc/udev/rules.d__, for the usb name resolving to ttyx80sv
