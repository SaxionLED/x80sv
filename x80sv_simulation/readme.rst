Simulation of the x80sv
=======================

This ROS package contains simulation scenarios for the x80sv robot. The launch file will load an
empty world, load controllers and launch a file that listens to the /cmd_vel topic.

To launch the simulation of the x80sv run:

  roslaunch x80sv_simulation simulation.launch

You will then see this:
